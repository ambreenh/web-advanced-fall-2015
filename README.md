# web-advanced-fall-2015

These are the files that the MFADT Parsons students can reference as we build out web apps using HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.

The first month of September we'll review HTML, CSS, SASS and responsive design.
In October, we'll talk through how you can connect with APIs, the fundamentals of JavaScript, and learn how to build some common interactive elements, such as lightboxes and carousels.
In November, we'll create server-side applications using PHP and MySQL to create and manipulate databases.
At the end of the semester, we can publish your code as reference.
